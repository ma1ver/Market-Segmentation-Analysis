# 🍔 Fast Food Market Segmentation Analysis

## 📋 Project Overview
This project implements a **market segmentation analysis** for the fast food industry using Python. The analysis follows the **Ten Steps of Market Segmentation** as outlined in the "Market Segmentation Analysis" book. It leverages data-driven methods like **clustering** and **PCA** to identify and profile customer segments effectively.

The code is designed to be **Google Colab-compatible**, enabling easy execution and visualization of results.

## 🔍 Features

- **Data Collection:** Load and preprocess real-world fast food customer data via CSV.
- **Perceptual Mapping:** Use PCA to visualize customer preferences.
- **Clustering:** Identify market segments using **k-means clustering**.
- **Segment Profiling:** Analyze segment-specific characteristics.
- **Targeting:** Evaluate and select segments for customized marketing.
- **Marketing Mix Development:** Propose tailored strategies for selected segments.

## 🚀 Steps Implemented

1. **Deciding (Not) to Segment:** Strategic decision-making.
2. **Specifying Ideal Target Segment:** Define criteria for target customer segments.
3. **Collecting Data:** Load data using `pandas.read_csv`.
4. **Exploring Data:** Preprocess and clean data for analysis.
5. **Extracting Segments:** Cluster data into segments using k-means.
6. **Profiling Segments:** Identify defining features of each segment.
7. **Describing Segments:** Visualize and describe segment characteristics.
8. **Selecting Target Segments:** Evaluate segments based on predefined metrics.
9. **Customizing Marketing Mix:** Develop marketing strategies tailored to the chosen segment.
10. **Evaluation and Monitoring:** Plan continuous monitoring and adjustments.
